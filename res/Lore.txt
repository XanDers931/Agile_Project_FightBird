Once upon a time there was a bird like any other, at least like the other birds of the Fight Bird.
This bird named Flap-Flap, a noble and heroic name corresponding well to a bird of his caliber, 
I mean a bird that goes wild with his objective, just going forward...through pipes... yeah pipes and again and again.
How far would you get in the Fight Bird.
One last thing, we do not talk about the Fight Bird, simple question of good cense.
