Once upon a time there was a bird like any other, at least like the other birds of the Fight Club.
This bird named Flap-Flap, a noble and heroic name corresponding well to a bird of its caliber, I mean a bird that goes wild with the blow of liner because are objective in life these advance...through pipes... yeah pipes and again and again.
How far would you get in the fight club.
In is one last thing, we do not talk about the Fight Bird, simple question of good cense.
